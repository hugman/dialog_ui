## Chat UI

When developing chatbot, we need a prototype user interface for proving concepts. 

Very simple HTML based chat interface is uploaded.
You can just use this code for your own purpose. 

Note that the style of the UI is from https://www.bypeople.com/minimal-css-chat-ui/#


I slightly modified the codes to be compatible with flask.

Have fun!.



Usuage : python runserver.py
